Generating the pocket-encompassing point field

Saving the point field as a PDB and NPY file
	Point field saved to /home/jvsguerra/remote-repos/SMC-Benchmarking/results/POVME/F2/F2_frameInfo/F2_inclusion.pdb to permit visualization
	Point field saved to /home/jvsguerra/remote-repos/SMC-Benchmarking/results/POVME/F2/F2_frameInfo/F2_inclusion.npy to optionally load for the volume calculation
