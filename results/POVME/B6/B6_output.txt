Generating the pocket-encompassing point field

Saving the point field as a PDB and NPY file
	Point field saved to /home/jvsguerra/remote-repos/SMC-Benchmarking/results/POVME/B6/B6_frameInfo/B6_inclusion.pdb to permit visualization
	Point field saved to /home/jvsguerra/remote-repos/SMC-Benchmarking/results/POVME/B6/B6_frameInfo/B6_inclusion.npy to optionally load for the volume calculation
