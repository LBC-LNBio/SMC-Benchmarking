A set of well-known metal organic compounds (MOCs) were selected from the literature to evaluate and validate benchmarking methods in the context of MOCs.

## Benchmarking methods

- KVFinder suite ([parKVFinder](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100606) and [pyKVFinder](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04519-4));
- [Fpocket](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-168);
- [McVol](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00894-009-0541-y);
- [pywindow](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00490 );
- [POVME](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00500);
- [GHECOM](https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.22639);
- [CAVER](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty386);
- [MoloVol](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576722004988);
- [PyVol](https://doi.org/10.1101/816702).

## Requirements

- [openbabel](https://pypi.org/project/openbabel/) (v3.1.1): is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages of chemical data. A wrapper that is automatically using the SWIG package and provide access to almost all of the Open Babel interfaces via Python.

- [pybel](https://pypi.org/project/pybel/) (v0.15.5): is a pure Python package for parsing and handling biological encoded in Biological Expression Language. A lightweight wrapper around openbabel module, that provides a more convenient and Pythonic ways to access the Open Babel toolkit.
